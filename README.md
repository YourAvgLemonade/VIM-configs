# VIM-configs

These are my vim configs. Just keeping these here to get the everyday setup of my favourite text editor anytime, anywhere. 
If you are interested in using these configs follow along!
#### Note: I will be updating these configs from time to time.

## How do I use these configs?
Glad you asked! 

### Step 1:
Do a `$ git clone https://github.com/YourAvgLemonade/VIM-configs`

### Step 2: 
Copy paste the `.vimrc` file from the cloned repo into the home directory 
_Hope you are aware the file is hidden so you need to do a `Ctrl + h` to show the file_

### Step 3:
Run `vim` and then do a `:PluginInstall` in command mode, this will install all the plugins for you. After they are 
installed you should be good.

## Screenshots
_I will post them here later :p_
